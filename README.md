# catsleep
A tool for reminder to take break in between works

## Introduction

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  
__catsleep__ is a tool for people working long hours in computer specially, programmers, software engineers and other IT professionals. Sometimes, we are so much engaged in a task that we forget to take break or have a walk that would be very harmfull to our both mental and physical health. So, we initiated this tiny effort for making a tool that would remind the person/user after a certain time to take a break, a refreshment so that s/he can concentrate to their work with a fresh mind and it would help them to keep their mental and physical health sound.
